# **I do believe that data is only powerful when it drives real decisions**

👋 Hello and welcome!

I'm Ilham Den Fatah, a **hybrid Data Analyst / Data Scientist** who operates at the intersection of **business, product, and data**. My work is grounded in one simple belief: the best analytics isn’t the most complex — it’s the most usable.  

Coming from a strong operational and business background, I learned early that beautiful models mean nothing if teams can’t act on them. That’s why my approach always follows the same arc:  
**clear problem framing → structured decision logic → reliable data → rigorous analysis → interpretable results → real business impact.**

### 🚀 What I bring to the table
I don’t position myself as “just a technical person.” I position myself as a **decision partner**.

My core strengths:
- **Business Framing & Decision Logic**  
  Translating vague business problems into precise questions, measurable outcomes, and clear decision rules.

- **SQL & Python Analytics (Production Mindset)**  
  Clean, reproducible, and structured workflows — not messy notebooks that die after presentation day.

- **End-to-End Ownership**  
  From raw data → pipeline → analysis → modeling → interpretation → decision layer → stakeholder communication.

In short: I don’t stop at “insights.” I go all the way to **actionable recommendations.**

### 📌 Signature projects (highlights worth your time)
These aren’t school assignments — they are **business-driven systems**.

**1) Retail Demand Forecasting & Decision System**  
An end-to-end forecasting system designed not for leaderboard accuracy, but for real operational decisions — inventory planning, safety stock, and scenario analysis.

**2) Retail Demand Risk Prioritization**  
A decision framework that ranks departments under demand uncertainty, translating technical signals into clear operational priorities.

**3) Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for Retail**  
A full workflow from data cleaning to probabilistic modeling and actionable customer segmentation for business strategy.

*(More projects below — each built with the same decision-first philosophy.)*

### 🛠 My technical toolkit
- **Core:** Python, SQL  
- **Analytics & ML:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels  
- **Data Engineering mindset:** reproducible pipelines, config-driven workflows, clear documentation  
- **Visualization & Storytelling:** decision-focused dashboards, not vanity charts

---

### 🎯 Where I’m headed
I’m targeting roles as a **BI Analyst, Data Analyst, or Data Scientist** in **retail, consulting, or product/tech companies** — environments where data truly shapes strategy and execution.

If you value:
- clarity over complexity,  
- impact over vanity metrics, and  
- decisions over dashboards,  

then you’re looking at the right GitHub profile.
